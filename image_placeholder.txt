PLACEHOLDER FOR TEMPLATE IMAGE

To complete this project, you need to add an image file named "tamplet1.jpg" to this directory.

This should be your media center template image that will be used as the background for the form data.

Until you add this image, the web application will show a broken image placeholder.

You can replace this with any image of your choice, but remember to update the field positions in the JavaScript code if you plan to add form functionality later.
